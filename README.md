# Window Segments Enumeration API

This repository proposes a JavaScript API that will help web developers effectively lay content out in a browser window that spans multiple displays or across the fold on foldable devices by providing the geometry of the available display regions.

The [EXPLAINER.md](/EXPLAINER.md) file highlights the motivation and the proposed API's syntax. Please take a look and if you have any feedback, thoughts or comments we'd love to hear them and opening an issue on this repo is a great start.
